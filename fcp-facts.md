# FCP Source-of-Truth Facts
<!-- This file is read by the /blog command before writing any post. All claims in blog posts MUST be verifiable against this file. Do not invent facts not listed here. -->

## The Program

- **Full Name:** Florida Coastal Prep Sports Academy (also: Florida Coastal Prep, FCP)
- **Location:** 33 Jet Drive NW, Fort Walton Beach, FL 32548 (Florida Panhandle / Emerald Coast)
- **Phone:** 850-961-2323 / 850-360-2323
- **Email:** info@floridacoastalprep.com
- **Website:** floridacoastalprep.com
- **Active programs:** High School Basketball (9th–12th grade) AND Post-Graduate Basketball — BOTH are active

## The Facility — Spartan Training Center

- **Name:** Spartan Training Center
- **Size:** 14,000 sq ft (INDOOR — this is an indoor facility, do NOT describe outdoor training as a feature)
- **Court:** NBA-dimension hardwood (94×50 ft)
- **Access:** 24/7 availability
- **Equipment:** Video board, shot clocks, 2 Shoot-Away shooting guns, 60 ft turf training zone, performance zone
- **CORRECT language:** "world-class indoor training facility," "14,000 sq ft Spartan Training Center," "NBA-dimension hardwood court"
- **NEVER say:** "outdoor training," "train outside," "outdoor courts" — FCP's primary competitive advantage is its premium indoor facility

## The Grind Session — CRITICAL: Read carefully

- **What it is:** An exclusive, ongoing basketball LEAGUE — a competitive game series, not a coaching clinic
- **Format:** FCP athletes compete alongside and AGAINST former NBA Draft Picks, overseas professionals, and top collegiate talent
- **CORRECT language:** "FCP athletes compete in the Grind Session," "compete alongside and against former NBA draft picks," "the highest level of competition available to prep players"
- **NEVER say:** "NBA draft picks coach our players," "NBA players mentor athletes daily," "our coaching staff includes NBA draft picks" — Kenny Anderson is on the coaching staff; the Grind Session participants are OPPONENTS / co-competitors in a league, not daily coaches
- **Kenny Anderson** (coaching staff) — Queens, NY native, 1991 2nd overall NBA Draft pick (New Jersey Nets), 14-year NBA career, 1994 NBA All-Star, former Fisk University head coach. He IS on staff as Basketball Coach / Skills Development Director.
