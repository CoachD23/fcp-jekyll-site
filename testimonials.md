      <p>Coach Lee DeForest was instrumental in putting my son in the position to compete against high level competition as well as in front of college coaches. He also used travel time to show players the different places around the country. That is something I think that's very important to the maturity of young men. My son matured and received a D1 scholarship and now plays for the Missouri Tigers.</p>

      <p>My son played for Coach DeForest and he did an awesome job with my son. He was a great mentor, and did a fantastic job in getting him ready for the next level. My son had zero offers coming out high school, and after completing his time at FCP, he had plenty of offers. Thank you Coach and FCP!!!</p>

      <p>Our son had the opportunity to play for Coach DeForest this past year. He is a talented coach and very passionate about the game and truly connected with his players. His commitment to see them succeed on and off the court sets him apart.</p>

      <p>My son played for Coach DeForest this past season, and I have to say that he is real professional as a coach and great person with a lot of patience for teaching today's kids to play and adapt to higher level of playing in order to receive future scholarships. He knows how to approach each kid and get a maximum of them. He is a role model for wherever he coaches. I highly recommend!</p>

      <p>I was informed that Coach Lee DeForest has joined the FCP program. By selecting him, you have secured a giant of a coach who understands how to teach the boys life skills as he teaches them basketball. My son played post-graduate ball for Coach DeForest during the 2018-2019 year.</p>
