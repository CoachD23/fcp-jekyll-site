      <p>"Coach Lee DeForest was instrumental in putting my son in the position to compete against high level competition as well as in front of college coaches. He also used travel time to show players the different places around the country. That is something I think that's very important to the maturity of young men. My son matured and received a D1 scholarship and now plays for the Missouri Tigers."</p>

My son had zero offers coming out high school, and after completing his time at FCP, he had plenty of offers. Thank you Coach and FCP!!!"</p>
