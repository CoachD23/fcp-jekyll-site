Regardless of the option chosen, our student-athletes can expect a safe, comfortable, and enjoyable living experience that will allow them to focus on their training and development. Whether it's the beach, shopping, or sports facilities, all of our housing options are conveniently located to ensure that our athletes have access to everything they need to succeed.

## Beach Condos

This housing option is 5 units split into multiple 2 bed and 1 bath units nestled along the picturesque Emerald Coast, this waterfront property offers the epitome of coastal living. Just a leisurely 3-minute stroll from the pristine white sands of the Gulf of Mexico, this oasis beckons with its unbeatable location and breathtaking views.

Comprising two duplex buildings with a total of four units, one flat studio plus a magnificent standalone house right on the water, this property is a rare gem. Our student-athletes love this option for its ample space, convenience to teammates, and proximity to the beach and local attractions.

## Beach House

This housing option is a multi-level vacation home with a private pool and patio. Located just steps away from Beach Access #1 on Okaloosa Island, this home offers beautiful views of the Gulf of Mexico and the intracoastal waterway from the balconies on the third floor.

The common area living room features 12' ceilings, a kitchen island with bar seating, a dining room table, and covered patios overlooking the pool. Our student-athletes love this option for its luxurious amenities and proximity to the beach and local attractions.

## Team Houses

One of our most popular options is one of our Team Houses. We have different options, but all include, bedrooms, bathrooms, full kitchens, big screen TVs, and lounge areas.

The Team Houses offer an environment that encourages both relaxation and team building. The lounge area and big screen TVs provide an excellent communal space for relaxation, entertainment, or even team strategizing. The option to review gameplays together or enjoy downtime watching shows or movies can indeed foster camaraderie and a stronger team dynamic. This option is particularly popular among our players because it provides a great opportunity for camaraderie and bonding under one roof.

## El Matador Housing

Our players stay in fully furnished 2 bed/2 bathroom apartments. Cable, Wi/Fi, and full access to a one of a kind beach resort is included. Our housing units are located next to 17 miles of uninhabited beach with a 12-acre beach resort that offers an array of amenities which includes two pools, tennis/pickle ball and basketball courts, a fitness center, whirlpools, saunas, and meeting rooms.
