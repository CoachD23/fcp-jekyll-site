    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="gold-rule"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-grid">
    <div class="faq-card fade-in">
      <h3>Do you provide I-20s?</h3>
      <p>Yes. I-20s are provided by our accredited educational partner, allowing international student-athletes to obtain F-1 student visas.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card fade-in">
      <h3>What is a Post-Grad Program?</h3>
      <p>A post-graduate program prepares athletes academically and athletically for college. Unlike traditional schooling, post-grad programs focus heavily on sports development while continuing academic progress — bridging the gap between high school and college.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card fade-in">
      <h3>What does this program guarantee?</h3>
      <p>While no program can guarantee a D1 scholarship, we guarantee a level of exposure, focused training, sports performance improvement, national-level competition, and meaningful playing time. Our track record of 100+ placements speaks for itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card fade-in">
      <h3>How will a post-grad year affect my NCAA eligibility?</h3>
      <p>The NCAA allows a one-year grace period after high school graduation (except tennis and hockey). During this time, a post-grad year will not affect your eligibility. You can compete at a high level while taking classes and building your academic profile — buying valuable time for the recruiting process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card fade-in">
      <h3>Do international athletes need health insurance?</h3>
      <p>Yes. All athletes in our program must have health insurance coverage. International athletes should arrange for an appropriate health insurance plan prior to arrival.</p>
