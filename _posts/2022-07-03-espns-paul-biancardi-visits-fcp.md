Paul Biancardi, ESPN's National Director of Recruiting, recently visited Florida Coastal Prep to share his expertise with the program's athletes.

Biancardi stated: "Love your program! First class treatment of players and you are pushing them to be their best."

FCP invited Biancardi to spend several days teaching basketball drills and concepts accumulated through his 35 years in college basketball. He addressed players about effective recruiting strategies, what Division 1 coaches seek in candidates, and how to maximize improvement during their time at FCP.

Biancardi toured all FCP residences and facilities during his stay. FCP is among Florida's first programs to adopt luxury bus transportation and was the first in the state to invite ESPN to campus.
