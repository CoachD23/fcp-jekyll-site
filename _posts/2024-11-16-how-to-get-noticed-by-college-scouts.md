Competition for college basketball spots is fierce, but specific actionable steps can improve your visibility to scouts and recruiters.

## Build a Highlight Reel That Pops

Create a 1-2 minute highlight reel featuring game footage against quality opponents. Place your strongest plays within the first 30 seconds, ensure high-quality video, maintain visible jersey numbers, and avoid offensive music. Upload to platforms like YouTube with clear titles and share links across social media.

## Maintain a Strong Social Media Presence

Social media functions as a public resume for athletes. Post about training sessions and game highlights while maintaining professionalism. Coaches monitor social media activity, making clean, positive content essential.

## Reach Out to Coaches and Programs

Direct outreach via email should include a personal introduction, program interest statement, highlight reel link, relevant statistics, and contact information.

## Show Your Skills at Showcase Events

Attending showcases demonstrates abilities before multiple scouts simultaneously while displaying work ethic and teamwork.

## Excel in Academics

Strong grades indicate discipline and time management, potentially unlocking academic scholarships.

## Build Great Relationships with Your Coaches

Coaches serve as advocates during recruitment. Demonstrating commitment and accepting feedback strengthens these critical relationships.

## Stay Dedicated and Keep Improving

Continuous improvement signals serious collegiate aspirations. Dedication and visibility combined create recruitment opportunities.
