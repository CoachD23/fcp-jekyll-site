In the fall of 2020, with a global pandemic shutting down gyms, canceling showcases, and freezing college recruiting, most high school seniors were waiting. Jack Hatten decided to drive.

The 6'6" guard from Bakersfield, California loaded up the car with his father John — a former Long Beach State basketball player — and made the 2,300-mile road trip east to Fort Walton Beach, Florida. The destination: Florida Coastal Prep.

## The Bet on Himself

Hatten had just wrapped up a solid career at Garces Memorial High School, averaging 11.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 1.3 steals per game as a senior. He was a two-sport athlete — football and basketball — with the size and skill to play at the next level. But COVID-19 had frozen the recruiting pipeline, and the offers weren't coming.

When FCP reached out via direct message on Twitter, Hatten saw an opportunity that most players would hesitate to take. A prep school 2,300 miles from home? During a pandemic? With no guarantees?

He took it anyway.

> That decision — the willingness to bet on yourself when nothing is certain — is what separates the players who make it from the ones who don't.

## Thriving at FCP

At Florida Coastal Prep, Hatten didn't just compete — he thrived. Playing against top-tier post-graduate programs in the Grind Session circuit, including matchups against powerhouses like IMG Academy and Montverde Academy, he earned heavy minutes from day one.

<li><strong>20-point performance</strong> in the conference tournament title game, including three three-pointers in an upset victory</li>
<li>Started and played major minutes in all 20+ games</li>
<li>Competed against future D1 and professional players nightly</li>
</ul>

Coach Lee DeForest recognized Hatten's impact immediately, praising his competitive intensity and describing his style of play as contagious — the kind of energy that lifts an entire roster.

## Earning a D1 Spot

The FCP exposure did exactly what it was supposed to do. After a season of proving himself against the best post-graduate talent in the country, Hatten earned what he'd driven 2,300 miles for — a Division I scholarship offer from the **University of Idaho** in the Big Sky Conference.

## More Than Basketball

At Idaho, Hatten has proven that his value extends far beyond the stat sheet. Named to the **NABC Honors Court** for academic excellence, he's exactly the kind of student-athlete that D1 programs build their culture around — a high-character competitor who brings it in the gym, in the classroom, and in the locker room.

His family's athletic legacy runs deep. Cousins Hayden Hatten (an All-America wide receiver who signed with the CFL's BC Lions) and Hogan Hatten (rookie long snapper for the Detroit Lions) prove that competitive excellence is in the DNA.

## The FCP Pipeline

Jack Hatten's story is the blueprint for what Florida Coastal Prep offers. A talented player from the West Coast who needed a platform, a development environment, and exposure to elite competition. FCP provided all three — and a D1 career was the result.

From Bakersfield to Fort Walton Beach to Moscow, Idaho. That's the kind of journey that changes a life.

> The dream was D1. The path went through FCP.
