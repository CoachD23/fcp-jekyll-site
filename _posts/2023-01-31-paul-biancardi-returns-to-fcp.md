Florida Coastal Prep is proud to announce the return visit of Coach Paul Biancardi, ESPN's National Director of Recruiting. This marks his second appearance at the academy.

Coach B's expertise and knowledge of the game, combined with his extensive experience in college basketball, make him an invaluable resource for our program. FCP is one of Florida's first prep programs to host ESPN on campus.

The visit served multiple purposes. Players gained insights into college basketball recruiting processes and learned what collegiate coaches seek in prospective athletes. Biancardi's evaluation focused on the academy's facilities, residential accommodations, and overall program quality.

We thank Coach B for his continued support and look forward to future engagements.
