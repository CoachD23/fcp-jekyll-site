Sean East II doesn't take the conventional path. He takes the right one.

The 6'3" point guard from Louisville, Kentucky has turned every detour into a springboard — from a post-graduate year under Coach DeForest to the NJCAA Player of the Year award to leading the SEC in scoring at Missouri to signing with the Los Angeles Lakers. And he's still climbing.

## Building Under Coach DeForest

Before the college offers started rolling in, East spent a pivotal post-graduate year playing under Coach DeForest. That season was the turning point.

Averaging over 20 points and 8 assists per game, East didn't just put up numbers — he developed the basketball IQ and leadership that coaches at every subsequent stop would rave about.

> He came in seeing the game from a coach's perspective. He was a vocal leader in practice with his energy and intensity and focus.
>
> <cite>Coach DeForest</cite>

That year sharpened East from a talented scorer into a complete floor general.

## The College Journey

East's college career reads like a masterclass in perseverance and self-belief:

<div class="timeline-stop">
<span class="timeline-pill">UMass '19-20</span>
<p>Started 20 of 31 games as a true freshman, leading the Minutemen with <strong>4.9 assists per game</strong> and averaging 9.3 points. The youngest starter on the roster — and already running the show.</p>
</div>

<div class="timeline-stop">
<span class="timeline-pill">Bradley '20-21</span>
<p>Transferred to the Missouri Valley Conference, started 20 games, and led the Braves with <strong>3.7 assists per game</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="timeline-stop">
<span class="timeline-pill">John A. Logan</span>
<p>Made a bold move to junior college — and it paid off in historic fashion. Named the <strong>NJCAA Division I Player of the Year</strong>, the most prestigious individual award in junior college basketball.</p>
</div>

<div class="timeline-stop">
<span class="timeline-pill">Missouri '22-24</span>
<p>Arrived in the SEC as a proven winner. In his final season, led the Tigers with <strong>17.6 points and 4.0 assists per game</strong> — the highest scoring average by a Missouri player since 2014. Named <strong>SEC Scholar-Athlete of the Year</strong>.</p>
</div>

## Signing with the Lakers

In June 2024, Missouri announced that East had signed an Exhibit 10 contract with the **Los Angeles Lakers**, becoming the third Tiger to sign with an NBA franchise in two seasons.

East made an immediate impression in the **2024 NBA Summer League**, appearing in seven games with four starts and averaging 6.9 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 2.9 assists. Scouts praised his jitterbug handles, pull-up shooting, and ability to control pace.

He was then selected **third overall** in the NBA G League Draft — a testament to how highly pro evaluators rated his game.

## Rising Star

Now with the **Salt Lake City Stars**, East has been nothing short of electric.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>2024-25 G League Stats — 33 Games</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>17.5 points</strong> per game</li>
<li><strong>5.6 assists</strong> per game</li>
<li><strong>2.8 rebounds</strong> per game</li>
<li><strong>1.0 steals</strong> per game</li>
<li><strong>27</strong> double-figure scoring games</li>
<li><strong>36-point</strong> season-high vs South Bay</li>
</ul>
</div>

That production earned him a selection to the **2026 NBA Rising Stars Game** during All-Star Weekend — playing alongside the league's most promising young talent on the biggest stage.

## The Path Matters

Sean East II's journey wasn't a straight line. It was a post-graduate year under Coach DeForest, four different colleges, a JUCO national player of the year award, and an SEC scoring title. Every single stop made him better.

> Now he's an NBA Rising Star, and the next chapter is being written in real time.
