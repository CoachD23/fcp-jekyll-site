Nathan Mariano's journey is one that every prep school athlete dreams about — and very few achieve.

The 6'9" forward from Franca, Brazil arrived at Florida Coastal Prep as a raw, talented prospect looking to sharpen his game against elite American competition. He left as a player ready for professional basketball.

## The FCP Foundation

At FCP, Mariano developed the two-way versatility that would define his professional career. Playing against top-tier post-graduate competition in the Grind Session circuit, he refined his footwork, expanded his perimeter game, and learned what it meant to compete at the highest level every single day.

The coaching staff recognized early that Mariano had rare physical tools — length, athleticism, and a motor that never stopped. But it was the mental development at FCP that transformed his ceiling from "professional prospect" to "NBA-caliber talent."

## Dominating the NBB

After his time at FCP, Mariano returned to his hometown club, Sesi Franca, and immediately made an impact in the NBB — Brazil's top professional league. What followed was a run of dominance that few young players in South American basketball have matched:

- **Four NBB Championships** with Sesi Franca, including a historic tetracampeonato
- **Basketball Champions League Americas 2023** title
- **Copa Intercontinental 2023** championship
- Averaged 6.0 points on 49% shooting and 3.8 rebounds in 17.8 minutes as a key rotation player in the 2024-25 NBB season

By 22 years old, Mariano had already won more professional championships than most players collect in an entire career.

## Wearing the Green and Gold

Mariano's consistent production with Franca earned him one of the most prestigious honors in Brazilian basketball — a call-up to the Seleção, Brazil's senior national team.

He represented his country in FIBA AmeriCup qualifying and helped Brazil capture the **FIBA AmeriCup 2025** title in Nicaragua. Playing alongside established veterans on the international stage, Mariano proved he belonged among the continent's best.

## The NBA Comes Calling

In 2025, Mariano entered the NBA Draft, catching the attention of scouts with his combination of size, championship pedigree, and defensive versatility. While he went undrafted, the **Phoenix Suns** immediately signed him to an Exhibit 10 contract — a deal that includes up to $85,300 in bonuses and a pathway to the NBA through their G League affiliate.

Mariano participated in training camp with the Suns' main roster before joining the **Valley Suns** in the G League, where he continues to develop his game against NBA-caliber competition every night.

## The Bigger Picture

Nathan Mariano's story isn't just about one player's success. It's proof that the development pathway works. A young player from Brazil came to Fort Walton Beach, Florida, put in the work at Florida Coastal Prep, and built a foundation that carried him to professional championships, international glory, and the doorstep of the NBA.

That's the FCP difference.
