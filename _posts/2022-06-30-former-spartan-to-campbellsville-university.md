Jordan Graham, a Class of 2019 Spartan Captain, committed to Campbellsville University in Kentucky, a traditional NAIA powerhouse. During his tenure with Florida Coastal Prep, Graham distinguished himself as a consistent winner and team captain, noted for his athletic versatility and coachability. He particularly improved his guard skills and outside shooting abilities.

Graham overcame multiple serious injuries that could have derailed his basketball career entirely. The psychological challenge of rehabilitation and the fear of returning to competitive play after injury posed significant obstacles. Graham ultimately exceeded his previous performance levels.

Following a successful 2019 season with the Spartans, Graham committed to Olney Central CC in a competitive JUCO conference. Despite battling a knee injury and navigating pandemic challenges, he earned a full scholarship and was recognized as a Mr. Basketball finalist and First Team All-State selection.

In an interview, Graham offered advice to incoming players: "Attack everyday with something to prove." Graham credited Coach DeForest's vision and family-like approach for his decision to join FCP.
