Kylin Green doesn't take the easy road. He takes the right one.

Four schools. Five years of college basketball. A JUCO conference title. A WAC championship ring. And now, a starting point guard role in Division I — running the show for Houston Christian University and hitting game-winners in front of a crowd that didn't know his name twelve months ago.

That's not a recruiting pitch. That's a résumé built one grind at a time — and it started at Florida Coastal Prep.

## Lewisville Made

Green grew up in Lewisville, Texas, a suburb in the heart of the DFW Metroplex. At Lewisville High School, he was the definition of a four-year starter who got better every single season.

By his senior year, Green wasn't just the best player on his team. He was the best scorer in the entire Metroplex at the 6A level — the highest classification in Texas high school basketball.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>Lewisville High School — Career Summary</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>1,634 career points, 638 rebounds, 332 assists, 226 steals</strong></li>
<li><strong>23.2 PPG as a senior</strong> — led the DFW Metroplex in 6A scoring</li>
<li><strong>District 6-6A Offensive MVP</strong></li>
<li><strong>All-District selection all four years</strong></li>
<li><strong>All-Region honoree</strong></li>
<li>Averaged <strong>24 PPG, 6 RPG, 4 APG</strong> in district play as a senior</li>
</ul>
</div>

In Texas, 6A is where the heavyweights play. Leading the entire Metroplex in scoring at that level isn't something you stumble into. Green earned it with a scorer's mentality and a point guard's mind — a combination that would define every stop on his journey.

> 1,634 points in four years. District MVP. The best scorer in the DFW Metroplex. And still, his best basketball was ahead of him.

## The FCP Foundation

After graduation, Green made the decision that separated him from other overlooked guards — he came to Florida Coastal Prep for a post-graduate year.

At FCP, Green went through the daily grind of the Grind Session circuit, competing against some of the best post-graduate talent in the country. The coaching staff saw a player with elite scoring instincts who needed to sharpen his point guard craft — the passing, the pace, the ability to control a game instead of just dominating it.

That year at FCP was the bridge. Green arrived as a scorer. He left as a playmaker.

## Daytona State: The JUCO Breakout

Green's next stop was Daytona State College, one of Florida's top JUCO programs. His freshman year was a lesson in patience — 6 starts, 3.3 points per game, learning a new system.

Then his sophomore season happened, and everything clicked.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>Daytona State — Sophomore Breakout (2023-24)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>13.7 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 5.6 APG, 2.6 SPG</strong></li>
<li><strong>59.8% from the field</strong> — elite efficiency</li>
<li><strong>55.3% from three-point range</strong> — scorching</li>
<li>Helped lead Daytona State to a <strong>28-4 record</strong></li>
<li><strong>Citrus Conference Championship</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

Read those shooting numbers again. Nearly 60% from the field. Over 55% from deep. In a conference where physicality defines every possession, Green was one of the most efficient guards in the entire NJCAA.

From 3.3 points as a freshman to 13.7 as a sophomore. From 6 starts to leading a 28-win team to a conference championship. That's the FCP development showing up — a player who learned at every level and never stopped getting better.

## Division I: Utah Valley

Green's Daytona State breakout earned him what he'd been working toward — a Division I opportunity at Utah Valley University in the WAC.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>Utah Valley — Junior Year (2024-25)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>33 games played</strong> — appeared in every single game</li>
<li><strong>4.7 PPG, 2.1 RPG, 1.7 APG</strong> off the bench</li>
<li><strong>42.9% from three</strong> — continued elite perimeter shooting</li>
<li>Helped Utah Valley win the <strong>outright WAC regular season title</strong></li>
<li>Team earned a berth in the <strong>National Invitation Tournament (NIT)</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

At Utah Valley, Green accepted a bench role — 15.5 minutes per game as a reliable guard off the pine. He didn't complain. He shot 43% from three, contributed to wins, and helped the Wolverines claim a conference championship.

A lot of players would have been satisfied with a conference title and an NIT berth. Green saw something else — an opportunity to prove he could be a starter, a floor general, a team leader. He just needed the right fit.

## Houston Christian: The Starter's Stage

Houston Christian University gave Green exactly what he'd earned — the keys to the offense.

After averaging 15.5 minutes at Utah Valley, Green nearly doubled his playing time at HCU, logging over 30 minutes per game as the starting point guard. The jump from bench contributor to primary facilitator in a Division I program is one of the hardest transitions in college basketball. Green made it look natural.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>Houston Christian — Senior Season (2025-26)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>10.2 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 4.6 APG</strong> as the starting point guard</li>
<li><strong>30.8 minutes per game</strong> — nearly doubled his Utah Valley role</li>
<li><strong>Career-high 24 points</strong> on five three-pointers vs. Bellarmine</li>
<li><strong>17 points, 9 assists</strong> vs. Southern Arkansas</li>
<li>Ranked <strong>tied for 99th nationally in assists per game</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

But the moment that defined his season — the play that captures everything about Kylin Green's career — came on a January night in Houston.

## The Game-Winner

January 19, 2026. Houston Christian versus Northwestern State. Sharp Gymnasium.

HCU trailed by 10 with nine minutes left. The kind of deficit that buries most teams. Green decided otherwise.

He orchestrated the entire comeback — 14 points and 10 assists on the night, just one turnover. A double-double from a point guard in a game his team had no business winning.

Then, with under ten seconds left and the score knotted at 80, Green took the ball at the top of the key, drove right, spun back inside the lane, and scooped a right-handed layup off the glass. The ball kissed the backboard and dropped through.

82-80 Houston Christian. Game over. Sharp Gymnasium erupted.

> 14 points, 10 assists, 1 turnover. A double-double. And the game-winning layup to cap a 10-point comeback. That's a point guard.

## The Bigger Picture

Kylin Green's path from Lewisville, Texas, to a Division I starting point guard at Houston Christian University is the kind of story that prep school basketball was built for.

A kid who scored 1,634 points in high school came to Florida Coastal Prep, learned how to run a team instead of just score on one, and then climbed — Daytona State, Utah Valley, Houston Christian. At every stop, he got better. At every level, he proved he belonged.

Four schools. Five years. A conference championship. A WAC title. Nearly 43% from three across two D1 seasons. And a game-winning layup that sent a building into chaos.

That's not luck. That's what happens when a Lewisville kid with FCP toughness decides the road isn't too long — it's just long enough.
