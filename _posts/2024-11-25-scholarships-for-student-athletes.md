## Scholarships for International Student-Athletes

U.S. colleges and universities are eager to welcome international students to their programs. International options include:

## Key Guidance

Many athletic and academic scholarships have deadlines months before the academic year begins. Start the search early.

## Balancing Academics and Athletics

Your performance on the court matters, but so does your success in the classroom. Stay organized, utilize college resources like tutoring, and communicate proactively with coaches and professors.
