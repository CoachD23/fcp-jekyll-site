Some players take the straight path. Gerald Gittens Jr. took the long one — and proved that the destination matters more than the route.

The 6'1" guard from Brooklyn, New York arrived at Florida Coastal Prep with the kind of toughness you can only forge on New York City blacktop. He left with the tools, the tape, and the confidence to build a four-year college career that would take him from JUCO to D2 to the D1 level.

## Built in Brooklyn

Gittens grew up in one of the most competitive basketball environments on earth. Brooklyn doesn't hand you anything — you earn every bucket, every minute, every ounce of respect. That edge showed up the moment he stepped on campus at FCP.

At Florida Coastal Prep, Gittens played against elite post-graduate competition in the Grind Session circuit, going head-to-head with future D1 and professional players every single day. The coaching staff saw a player with an advanced feel for the game — someone who could score from all three levels, set up teammates, and guard multiple positions.

> That multi-positional versatility became his calling card at every stop after FCP.

## The JUCO Foundation

After his time at FCP, Gittens headed to North Central Missouri College, where he spent two seasons sharpening his game against top JUCO competition. The growth was immediate and dramatic.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>North Central Missouri College</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>55 games played</strong> over two seasons</li>
<li><strong>12.9 PPG as a sophomore</strong> — nearly doubling his freshman output of 6.7 PPG</li>
<li><strong>4.8 rebounds and 4.6 assists per game</strong> as a sophomore — true multi-positional production</li>
<li>19 starts in 27 games during his breakout sophomore campaign</li>
</ul>
</div>

Those numbers told the story of a player who was getting better fast. Nearly 13 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists as a 6'1" guard? That's the kind of stat line that makes coaches at the next level pay attention.

## Taking Over at the University of Mary

Gittens transferred to the University of Mary for the 2023-24 season — and immediately became the best player on the roster.

Starting 27 of 28 games, he led the Marauders in scoring at **13.8 points per game** while adding 4.5 rebounds and 3.1 assists. He shot 42.6% from the field and a respectable 35.3% from behind the arc, proving he could hurt defenses from anywhere on the court.

His best moments showed just how dominant he could be when locked in — a 26-point explosion against Northern State and a 9-assist masterclass against Valley City State. When the Marauders needed a bucket or a play, Gittens was the one with the ball in his hands.

## Finishing at the D1 Level

After proving himself as an elite D2 scorer, Gittens earned what he'd been building toward his entire career — a Division I opportunity at **Northern Michigan University**.

As a senior in the GLIAC, Gittens started 26 of 32 games, averaging 8.6 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.2 assists, and 1.3 steals per game. But his impact went far beyond the box score.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>Northern Michigan — Senior Season</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>32 games played, 26 starts</strong> as a D1 senior</li>
<li><strong>13 double-figure scoring games</strong></li>
<li><strong>21-point senior night</strong> against Ferris State — his career-high at the D1 level</li>
<li><strong>18 points and 3 steals in the final 8:40</strong> of a comeback win over Wisconsin-Parkside</li>
<li><strong>13 multi-steal games</strong> — one of the GLIAC's most disruptive perimeter defenders</li>
</ul>
</div>

That Wisconsin-Parkside game was pure Gittens. The Wildcats were in a battle, and he took the game over — scoring all 18 of his points down the stretch while locking up on the defensive end. Brooklyn grit on a Division I stage.

## The Long Road, The Right Destination

Gerald Gittens Jr.'s path wasn't the one-and-done express lane to the next level. It was something better — a grind that made him tougher, smarter, and more complete at every single stop.

From FCP to JUCO to D2 to D1, he led teams in scoring, defended multiple positions, and proved that the kid from Brooklyn could compete with anyone, anywhere. That's a career. That's a legacy.

> From the blacktop to D1 — the path went through FCP.
