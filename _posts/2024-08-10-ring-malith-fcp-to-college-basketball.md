Some basketball stories start in suburban gyms or AAU tournaments. Ring Malith's starts in Twic, South Sudan — a world away from the hardwood floors of American college basketball.

What happened between there and the NCAA Tournament is the kind of journey that rewrites what people think is possible. An NJCAA National Championship. A Division I rebounding record. An OVC conference title. An NCAA Tournament berth. Two Player of the Week awards. And a senior season that had him leading the entire Ohio Valley Conference in scoring before a knee injury cut it short.

All of it — every single stop — traces back to the foundation built at Florida Coastal Prep.

## The Journey Begins

Malith arrived in the United States with raw physical tools that are almost impossible to teach — 6'9" with guard skills, the ability to handle the ball in the open floor, shoot from the perimeter, and rebound above the rim. But raw tools don't win games. Preparation does.

That's where Florida Coastal Prep came in.

At FCP, Malith went through the process of adapting to American basketball — the pace, the physicality, the scouting, the structure. The coaching staff saw a player with a skill set that didn't fit neatly into any position box. He could play the four but shoot like a two. He could rebound like a center but push the ball in transition like a point guard.

> FCP didn't try to put Malith in a box. They built the box around his game — and then taught him how to break out of it.

That versatility would become his calling card at every level.

## Barton Community College: National Champion

After FCP, Malith landed at Barton Community College in Great Bend, Kansas — one of the most competitive JUCO programs in the country. He didn't just survive. He thrived.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>Barton Community College — 2023-24 Season</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>37 games played, 37 starts</strong></li>
<li><strong>12.2 PPG, 4.6 RPG</strong></li>
<li><strong>47% FG, 38% from three</strong></li>
<li>Part of a team that went <strong>36-1</strong> — winning the final 27 consecutive games</li>
<li>Named to the <strong>NJCAA All-Tournament Team</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

But the numbers don't tell the real story. The real story happened on March 30, 2024, in the NJCAA National Championship game.

Barton versus Triton College. The biggest game in Barton program history.

Malith scored **22 points** on 4-of-7 from three-point range with 3 steals. When Triton was hanging around early, it was Malith's pair of three-pointers that sparked the run that gave Barton a 23-21 lead — a lead they would never relinquish.

Final score: Barton 88, Triton 73. **Barton's first-ever NJCAA National Championship.**

<h4>🏆 NJCAA National Championship Game</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>22 points</strong> on 4-of-7 from three</li>
<li><strong>3 steals</strong></li>
<li>Sparked the decisive run with back-to-back threes</li>
<li>Named <strong>NJCAA All-Tournament Team</strong></li>
<li>Barton's <strong>first-ever national title</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

A kid from Twic, South Sudan, hitting threes in a national championship game and walking off the floor as a champion. That's not a fairy tale. That's an FCP product.

## SIUE: Immediate D1 Impact

When SIU Edwardsville head coach Brian Barone signed Malith in May 2024, he knew exactly what he was getting — a national champion with size, shooting, and a motor that doesn't quit.

Malith didn't need a transition year. He was an immediate starter and one of the best players in the Ohio Valley Conference from day one.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>SIUE — Junior Year (2024-25)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>34 games, 11.1 PPG, 7.0 RPG</strong></li>
<li><strong>6 double-doubles</strong></li>
<li>Scored in <strong>double figures in 20 games</strong></li>
<li>Hit at least one three in <strong>29 of 33 games</strong></li>
<li>Ranked <strong>4th in the OVC in rebounding</strong></li>
<li><strong>19 rebounds vs. St. Ambrose</strong> — set the <strong>SIUE Division I program record</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

Nineteen rebounds. In a single game. A program record at the Division I level. For a player who can also step out and drain threes. That's the kind of unicorn production that doesn't come along often.

But Malith was just getting started.

## The OVC Championship Run

March 2025. The OVC Tournament. SIUE had never won the conference tournament. Never reached the NCAA Tournament as a D1 program. Ring Malith and the Cougars changed that — permanently.

Malith averaged 10 points and 5.5 rebounds per game through the tournament bracket, earning a spot on the **OVC All-Tournament Team** as SIUE rolled to the championship game against top-seeded Southeast Missouri State.

The final: **SIUE 69, Southeast Missouri 48.** A 21-point demolition. SIUE's first-ever OVC Tournament Championship. And with it, the program's **first-ever NCAA Division I Tournament berth**.

> From South Sudan to the NCAA Tournament. An NJCAA national championship. An OVC championship. A Division I rebounding record. And he was just a junior.

## Senior Year: The OVC's Best

The OVC named Malith to its **Preseason Players to Watch** list heading into 2025-26. He answered by becoming the conference's leading scorer.

<div class="highlight-box">
<h4>SIUE — Senior Season (2025-26, before injury)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>14 games, 17.0 PPG, 5.4 RPG</strong></li>
<li><strong>47.7% FG</strong> — career-best efficiency</li>
<li><strong>Career-high 31 points and 10 rebounds</strong> vs. North Florida</li>
<li>Scored <strong>20+ points six times</strong> in just 14 games</li>
<li><strong>2x OVC Player of the Week</strong> (Dec. 8 and Dec. 29)</li>
<li>Leading the <strong>entire OVC in scoring</strong> at the time of injury</li>
</ul>
</div>

The North Florida game on December 2, 2025 was vintage Malith. SIUE trailed. Malith took over. He scored the final 9 points himself, sparking an 18-2 run that turned a deficit into a 72-63 victory. Thirty-one points. Ten rebounds. A double-double that looked like something out of a movie.

Three weeks later, he did it again — 24 points on elite shooting in a win over Western Illinois. The OVC gave him Player of the Week for the second time. At that point, nobody in the conference was scoring at a higher rate.

Then, on January 8, 2026, the news broke. A knee injury. Season over.

## The Bigger Picture

Ring Malith's basketball journey is one of the most remarkable in FCP history.

A kid from Twic, South Sudan, came to Florida Coastal Prep with raw talent and an impossible dream. FCP gave him the foundation — the daily development, the exposure, the preparation for what American college basketball demands. Then he took that foundation and built something extraordinary.

An NJCAA National Championship at Barton — 22 points in the title game. An immediate D1 impact at SIUE — a program rebounding record in his first season. An OVC Tournament Championship and the school's first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance. Two OVC Player of the Week awards. The conference scoring lead as a senior.

Three schools. Two conference championships. One national title. A rebounding record. An NCAA Tournament berth. And a senior season that was on pace to be historic before a knee injury intervened.

That's not a path. That's a legacy — and it started at FCP.
