Another athlete from Florida Coastal Prep's Class of 2022 has committed to college basketball. Nadav Naim, a 6'1 guard from Israel, pledged to Palm Beach State College.

Like many players pursuing collegiate opportunities, he exercised patience throughout the recruiting process. Having completed mandatory military service in Israel, Naim sought an established program to advance his athletic development.

This represents the second Israeli-born player coached by Coach DeForest to advance to college basketball. In 2019, Jovan Zelenbaba committed to Northwestern State in the Southland Conference.

When asked about advice for incoming players, Naim stated: "Just keep working hard everyday and not give up. Post grad in FCP is not easy at all."

His favorite memory involved the state tournament semifinals, when his team defeated Miami Prep — the best team in Florida at that time — in a significant upset victory.

Regarding his college choice, Naim explained he selected FCP because he heard only good things about Coach DeForest and valued a place with good people that care about him.
