## What is a Post-Graduate Year?

Many high school graduates are familiar with the concept of a gap year after graduation. While little data is kept on the exact number of students taking a gap year, it is reported that gap years' popularity has been on the rise over the past few years, with an estimated 22% increase in gap year participation since 2015.

A postgraduate (PG) year at Florida Coastal Prep is a development-focused gap year. The primary objective of a PG year is to strengthen students' candidacy for admission and increase their potential for success in college.

## What did COVID-19 change about recruiting?

The COVID-19 pandemic has made it harder to earn NCAA basketball scholarships, and the best college teams are now older due to an extra year of eligibility granted to student-athletes. Coaches are now looking for experienced players who can contribute immediately to the team's success, rather than taking a chance on a younger, less experienced athlete.

As a result, it is much harder for younger high school athletes to earn a spot on a team. Pursuing post-grad studies can increase a player's chances of earning a scholarship by providing an extra year to develop skills and gain experience.

## What is the benefit of a post grad year?

1. **Improved Skills:** The additional year of eligibility allows players to further develop their skills and increase their proficiency in the game. Players can use the PG year to work on their weak areas and build on their strengths.

2. **Physical Development:** Players can use the PG year to improve their physical attributes, such as strength, speed, and agility. This extra year of training can help players improve their overall athleticism, which is crucial for success at the college level.

3. **Enhanced Exposure:** A PG year at Florida Coastal Prep gives players the opportunity to compete on a national stage, gaining exposure to college coaches and scouts who may not have seen them during their high school career.

4. **Informed School Selection:** With additional time and guidance from experienced coaches, players can make more informed decisions about which college program is the best fit for their academic and athletic goals.

5. **Academic Strengthening:** The extra year allows students to improve their GPA, complete additional coursework, or raise standardized test scores, making them stronger candidates for college admissions and athletic scholarships.

6. **College Game Preparation:** The PG year bridges the gap between high school and college basketball, preparing players for the faster pace, increased physicality, and higher expectations of the collegiate game.

7. **Increased Maturity:** An additional year of development in a structured, college-like environment helps players grow emotionally and mentally, building the resilience and discipline needed to succeed at the next level.
