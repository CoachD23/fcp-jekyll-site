    </div>
    <p>While gap year popularity has risen — with an estimated 22% increase since 2015 — a PG year at FCP is different. It's structured, competitive, and designed to make you a stronger college candidate from every angle.</p>
    <p>Our program combines elite basketball development, academic improvement, and the maturity that comes from living in a competitive team environment.</p>

    <h2>Why PG Matters More Than Ever</h2>
    <div class="gold-rule"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="page-intro" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed college recruiting permanently. The extra year of eligibility granted to existing college athletes means rosters are older and spots are fewer. Coaches now look for experienced players who can contribute immediately.</p>
    <p>A post-graduate year gives you the edge — more film, better stats, greater maturity, and a stronger academic profile. It's no longer optional for many players; it's the smartest path to a college roster.</p>
