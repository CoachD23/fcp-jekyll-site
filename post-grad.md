## What is a Post-Graduate Year?

Many high school graduates are familiar with the concept of a gap year after graduation. While little data is kept on the exact number of students taking a gap year, it is reported that gap years' popularity has been on the rise over the past few years, with an estimated 22% increase in gap year participation since 2015.

A postgraduate (PG) year at Florida Coastal Prep is a development-focused gap year. The primary objective of a PG year is to strengthen students' candidacy for admission and increase their potential for success in college.

## Taking a PG year at Florida Coastal Prep provides several benefits, including:

**Academic Improvement:** Students who take a PG year at Florida Coastal Prep can choose to take college courses through our dual enrollment partner or prepare for the ACT.

**Increased Athletic Opportunities:** Florida Coastal Prep offers a variety of strategies that increase exposure along with developing their athletic abilities to increase their chances of being recruited by colleges.

**Greater Social, Emotional, and Mental Development:** In a tight-knit community like Florida Coastal Prep, students have the opportunity to learn and grow collaboratively, developing their social, emotional, and mental skills.

**Extended College Readiness:** Florida Coastal Prep provides a structured college-like environment, allowing students to practice time management, school/life balance, and social skills that are crucial to success in college and beyond.

## The Program Offers:

- **Exposure:** The program's national schedule provides plenty of opportunities for players to showcase their abilities to college recruiters and boost their recruitment prospects.
- **Recruiting:** The program's experienced coaching staff helps players navigate the recruitment process and gain exposure to a wide range of college programs.

- **Competition:** The program's competitive environment challenges players to improve their skills and perform at their best, helping them to prepare for the rigors of college basketball.

## What did COVID-19 change about recruiting?

The COVID-19 pandemic has made it harder to earn NCAA basketball scholarships, and the best college teams are now older due to an extra year of eligibility granted to student-athletes. Coaches are now looking for experienced players who can contribute immediately to the team's success, rather than taking a chance on a younger, less experienced athlete.

As a result, it is much harder for younger high school athletes to earn a spot on a team. Pursuing post-grad studies can increase a player's chances of earning a scholarship by providing an extra year to develop skills and gain experience.

## What is the benefit of a post grad year?

1. **Improved Skills:** The additional year of eligibility allows players to further develop their skills and increase their proficiency in the game. Players can use the PG year to work on their weak areas and build on their strengths.

2. **Physical Development:** Players can use the PG year to improve their physical attributes, such as strength, speed, and agility. This extra year of training can help players improve their overall athleticism, which is crucial for success at the college level.---
