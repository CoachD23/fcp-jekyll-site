  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; text-align: justify; margin: 0;">A postgraduate year is a development-focused gap year designed to strengthen every dimension of your college candidacy — athletically, academically, and personally. While gap year popularity has risen with an estimated 22% increase since 2015, a structured PG year at an elite prep academy is different: it's competitive, intentional, and built to get you recruited.</p>

    <div class="gold-rule" style="margin: 0.75rem 0 1.25rem;"></div>
    <p style="font-size: 1.08rem; line-height: 1.75; color: #333; text-align: justify;">A post-graduate year is an additional year of academic and athletic development after high school graduation. Rather than heading directly to college, student-athletes enroll at a prep academy where they continue their education while competing at a higher level of basketball.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.08rem; line-height: 1.75; color: #333; text-align: justify;">The goal is simple: arrive at college as a stronger student, a better player, and a more mature young man. PG programs combine elite coaching, structured academics, strength and conditioning, and direct college recruiting support — all within a single focused year.</p>

    <div class="gold-rule" style="margin: 0.75rem 0 1.25rem;"></div>
    <p style="font-size: 1.08rem; line-height: 1.75; color: #333; text-align: justify;">The college recruiting landscape has never been more competitive. With the transfer portal expanding rosters and creating year-round roster movement, coaches increasingly value experienced players who can contribute immediately.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.08rem; line-height: 1.75; color: #333; text-align: justify;">A post-graduate year gives you the edge — more film, stronger stats, greater maturity, and an enhanced academic profile. For many athletes, a PG year is no longer optional — it's the smartest path to earning a roster spot and maximizing scholarship opportunities.</p>
