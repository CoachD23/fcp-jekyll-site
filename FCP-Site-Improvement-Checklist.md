# Florida Coastal Prep — Site Improvement Checklist

Prioritized by expected impact on enrollment and revenue. Work through these one at a time.

---

## Priority 1 — High Impact / Do First

- [ ] **1. College Placement & Alumni Outcomes Page**
  Create a dedicated page showcasing where FCP athletes have committed — school logos, athlete photos, signing day moments. This is the #1 thing parents search for when evaluating academies. Add commitment data as structured content so it's indexable by search engines.

- [ ] **2. On-Site Lead Capture Form (Homepage + Key Pages)**
  There are currently zero forms on the site. Add an inquiry/application form above the fold or as a sticky element. Capture name, email, phone, sport, grad year. Connect to GHL for instant follow-up.

- [ ] **3. Automated Nurture Sequence (GHL SMS + Email)**
  Once form leads come in, trigger a 14-day drip: welcome SMS → coach intro email → virtual tour invite → testimonial highlight → scarcity/deadline message. This turns cold inquiries into campus visits.

## Priority 2 — Strong ROI / Do Next

- [ ] **4. Schema Markup Upgrade**
  Add `EducationalOrganization`, `Course` (one per program), `FAQPage`, and `Review` schema types. Currently only `WebSite` and `SportsOrganization` are present. This unlocks rich snippets in Google and improves click-through rates.

- [ ] **5. Free Assessment / Evaluation Funnel**
  Offer a free skills evaluation or recruiting assessment as a lead magnet. Dedicated landing page with form → confirmation → calendar booking. Lowers the barrier from "apply now" to "get a free eval."

- [ ] **6. Dedicated Landing Pages per Program**
  Create individual pages for baseball, basketball, football, soccer, etc. with keyword-targeted content (e.g., "post-grad baseball academy Florida"). Each page gets its own meta title, description, and Course schema.

- [ ] **7. Sticky CTA Bar**
  Add a persistent top or bottom bar with a phone number and "Schedule a Visit" button that stays visible as users scroll. High-performing academies convert 2-3x more with persistent CTAs.

## Priority 3 — Solid Improvements

- [ ] **8. Google Business Profile + Local SEO**
  Claim/optimize the GBP listing with photos, posts, Q&A, and review responses. Add `LocalBusiness` schema. Target "sports academy near me" and "[sport] academy [city]" searches.

- [ ] **9. Video SEO — Embed Docuseries & Training Footage**
  Embed highlight reels, facility tours, and athlete testimonials directly on the site. Add `VideoObject` schema to each. Video pages rank 53x more likely on Google page 1.

- [ ] **10. Blog Content Strategy Shift**
  Move from generic posts to athlete spotlights, signing day announcements, coach features, and "day in the life" content. These are shareable, linkable, and target long-tail recruiting keywords.

- [ ] **11. Virtual Campus Tour Page**
  Create an immersive tour page with video walkthroughs, 360° photos, or a narrated slideshow of facilities, housing, and training areas. Critical for out-of-state families who can't visit in person first.

- [ ] **12. Live Chat or SMS Widget**
  Add a chat widget (GHL chat widget or similar) so visitors can ask questions instantly. Even a simple "Text us" button tied to GHL conversations captures leads that would otherwise bounce.

## Priority 4 — Polish & Optimize

- [ ] **13. Social Proof Counter Animation**
  Animate the Impact Stats bar numbers (count up on scroll). Add a few more data points — D1 commits, states represented, average roster size. Motion draws attention and builds credibility.

- [ ] **14. Parent vs. Player Toggle / Segmentation**
  Add a simple "I'm a Parent" / "I'm an Athlete" selector on the homepage or form. Route each to tailored messaging — parents care about academics and safety, athletes care about competition and exposure.

- [ ] **15. Tuition Transparency**
  Add a tuition overview or "Investment" section with ranges, what's included, and financial aid/payment plan info. Academies that show pricing upfront attract more qualified leads and fewer tire-kickers.

- [ ] **16. Showcase & Event Calendar**
  Add a calendar or upcoming events section — prospect days, showcases, combines, open gyms. Give families a reason to visit and a deadline to act.

- [ ] **17. Referral / Partner Program**
  Create a referral incentive for current families and a partner page for travel ball coaches, club directors, and high school coaches who send athletes your way.

- [ ] **18. Urgency & Scarcity Messaging**
  Replace generic CTAs with specific roster counts — "Only 4 baseball spots remain for Fall 2026." Real scarcity backed by real numbers drives faster decisions.
